Display the patient ID and create a new column that calculates how much each patient still needs to pay. Call the new column payment_remaining.
SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill - payment_received AS payment_remaining
FROM billing;

Select every patient ID, the procedure bill, and create a new column that calculates the fraction of what the patient has paid toward their procedure bill. Call the new column payment_fraction and sort it from low to high.
SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
FROM billing
ORDER BY payment_fraction;

Display the patient ID, payment_fraction (copy from the previous query), and add a column displaying the percent of the bill that the patient has paid, rounded to one place. Call the new column payment_percent.
SELECT patient_id
, payment_received / procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
, ROUND((payment_received / procedure_bill)*100, 1) AS payment_percent
FROM billing;
