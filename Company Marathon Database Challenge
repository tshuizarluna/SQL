In this SQL challenge, I used a database that contains information about a fictional group of coworkers who ran in a marathon sponsored by their fictional company. This database includes each participant's name, the fraction of the marathon they completed, and whether they've run un a marathon before.

CREATE TABLE marathon (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   participant_name TEXT,
   previous_experience TEXT,
   completion_fraction REAL);

INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Sadie Hawkins", "yes", 1);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Brandon Flowers", "no", 0.241);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Michael Scott", "no", 0.804);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Karamo Brown", "yes", 0.9512);
INSERT INTO marathon (participant_name, previous_experience,  completion_fraction)
    VALUES ("Antoni Porowski", "yes", 0.640);

Select every participant name and the percent of the marathon that they completed.
SELECT participant_name,
completion_fraction*100 AS completion_percentage
FROM marathon

Select every participant name and the percent of the marathon that they completed. Show the percent of the marathon completed rounded to one decimal place.
SELECT participant_name
, ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) as completion_percent 
FROM marathon;
